## About Me

Hi there, my name is Eltone Mabodo, and I hold a Masters in Economics degree, specialising in Health Economics. 

I am a Nutrition Data Scientist and Applied Economist with advanced expertise in survey statistics, impact evaluation, and spatial analysis. Trained in econometrics at the master’s level and experienced with R-based workflows, I work at the intersection of causal inference, policy modeling, and data-driven decision-making in the fields of nutrition, food security, and development.

My experience spans across UN agencies projects, where I’ve led the analysis of complex household survey data, developed policy-relevant indicators (e.g. FIES, ECMEN, LCS-EN, DDS, MAD), and integrated geospatial data into targeting frameworks. I combine rigorous analytical methods with intuitive data storytelling — supporting stakeholders with evidence for programming, targeting, and resource allocation.

I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable insight using tools like tidyverse, survey, sf, ggplot2, brms, with a growing focus on forecasting, Bayesian modeling, and small area estimation. My work reflects a commitment to equity, transparency, and scientific integrity in solving real-world challenges.
